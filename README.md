# Learning and development
My recommendations on where to invest your learning and development budget

## Why

Majority of tech companies offer an annual budget for learning and development. The intention is to help employees to develop or strengthen skills in persue of career development. Often, this budget can be used in multiple things like

- Books
- Subscriptions to learning platforms
- Conferences

As an engineering leader, I see a common pattern where individual contributors don't take the full advantage of this budget. So here I am, trying to put in public my personal recommendations on where to use that money and invest on your personal growth.
